<h3>Steps for use: </h3>
<ol style="margin-bottom:10px;">

<li>Hover over it and copy the password.</li><br>
<li>when you're finished with it, <b>Right-Click</b> it and it will go away.</li><br>
<li>To change the letter count of the passwords, open the code, change the value for len, and then save!</li><br>

</ol>


<h3>Key points:</h3>
<ul style="margin-bottom:10px;">
<li>The passwords are randomly generated by an algorithm and usually contain symbols, numbers, and lower & capital case letters. 👮‍♂️</li><br>
<li>Sometimes the box is placed over the input or in a place that makes it function incorrectly.<br>To fix, copy the password then right click to delete it. ❌</li><br>
<li>Save these passwords somewhere as it will be hard for you to remember them. 💭</li><br>
<li>The current value for len (password length) is 12, which is pretty safe. <br>If you don't think so, feel free to change it. 👌</li><br>
